            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE enſuing <hi>Apologetick defence of the Miniſtry and Miniſters of the Church of England,</hi> can hardly expect more <hi>Readers</hi> than ſevere <hi>Cenſurers;</hi> of whom ſome will be wearied with the length, others offended with the freedome: ſome deſpiſers of the manner, others contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicters of the matter: In ſum, it lookes for not many, or any friends; but ſuch as are humble, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and impartiall; And not a few enemies, of thoſe that are proud, ignorant and biaſſed by ſecular intereſts. So pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent are our enemies grown even in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that few can bear, either their diſeaſes, or their remedies. Albeit the age extreamly wants, yet it can hardly endure a plain and faithfull ſtile; though it keeps the <hi>medium</hi> between ſeverity and flattery, bitterneſſe and dulneſſe, moroſe antiquity and petulant novelty. It is ſome mens Religion to have none ſetled by education or profeſſion; Others cavill at all that hath been taught or eſtabliſhed: Many eſteem their <hi>Levity</hi> in opinions, and inconſtancy in profeſſion to be a kinde of <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> in Religion; Never thinking themſelves to be, what they ſhould be, till they are, what they liſt: judging that Liberty, which is <hi>Lawleſneſſe,</hi> and that freedome, which is without fear of God, or reverence of man: calling that piety with peace, which is the diſſolving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating of all publique ſociety, order, unity, and polity in Churches; crying up their later fragments, and broken meats; being all thoſe loaves and fiſhes, with which Chriſt hath for ſo
<pb facs="tcp:125554:4"/> many hundred of years fed his Church and people in all the world.</p>
            <p>Others of deeper reaches taking the advantage of ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular eaſineſſe and credulity, which is leſſe ſeparable from the vulgar, than ſhadowes are from groſſe bodies, ſtudy to variate and ſhift the extern forms and models of Religion, untill the ſacred and eternall intereſts of Gods glory, and mans ſalvation are drawn to ſtoop to, or forced to comply with temporary deſignes, and ſecular policies; where <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be made to ſerve <hi>Belial; God</hi> to how down to <hi>Mammon;</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> muſt become captive to <hi>Dagon;</hi> piety turn page to ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; and Religion be onely entertained as a <hi>lackey</hi> for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; Where there are ſuch abaſings, diſtortings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formings of the beauty and rectitude of Chriſtian Religion, (ſowring the <hi>wine</hi> of <hi>Primitive verity,</hi> ſimplicity, and charity, with the <hi>vinegar</hi> of worldly jealouſie, craft and cruelty) what can be expected, as to any thing written, in behalf of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and its holy <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> with a plain, free, and upright genius, but onely ſuch <hi>fate and doome,</hi> as the ſeverall humors, parties, prejudices, and worldly intereſts of men will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford? which being ſo divided, and thwarting each other, it will be hard to pleaſe any one, without diſpleaſing many.</p>
            <p>The Author therefore (who writes as addicted to no faction:) nor perſonally <hi>injured,</hi> or <hi>obliged</hi> by any novel parties, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying only to diſcharge a good conſcience, as to men, ſo chiefly toward God, (the aſſiſtance of whoſe <hi>Heroick Spirit,</hi> and free grace he humbly begs through all this work) neither ſeeks, nor hopes to pleaſe any men, whoſe paſſionate adherence to any <hi>ſidings</hi> either in civill or religious concernments, leſſe inclines them to that calm, judicious, and charitable temper, which is <hi>Scripturall, Catholick,</hi> and truly <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> This he onely ſtudies, this he preacheth, for this he prayes, this he commends, this he admires: Not doting upon any <hi>ruſt or droſſe,</hi> which ancient and venerable <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> might in many hundred of years eaſily contract; and from which it may as eaſily be cleared, if men impartially ſought the things of
<pb facs="tcp:125554:4"/> Jeſus Chriſt, and his Churches proſperity, without gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any paſſion in themſelves or others. Nor yet doth the <hi>Author</hi> any whit admire thoſe <hi>rigid Reformations,</hi> which ſome raſh, envious, or ambitious <hi>Presbyters</hi> drive on; who know not how to ſhave their <hi>Fathers</hi> beards without cutting their throats; nor to pair their nailes without cropping off their hands.

            <p>From which, <hi>private fancies,</hi> aims and intereſts, afterward varying, both in opinion and practiſe, occaſioned thoſe many uncomfortable, ſchiſms, and uncharitable factions, which (in all times, and now as much as ever) ſo divide the <hi>unity,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>charity,</hi> and deform the <hi>beauty</hi> of Chriſtian Religion;
<pb facs="tcp:125554:5"/> That many, if not moſt Chriſtians, doe not onely <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>hear; write,</hi> and <hi>diſpute; pray,</hi> and <hi>preach;</hi> but they <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>repent;</hi> love, or hate; damn, or ſave; <hi>communicate</hi> with, or <hi>excommunicate</hi> one another, moſt-what, out of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>conſtitutions,</hi> as they are of more calm and cholerick <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers;</hi> or out of thoſe <hi>prejudices</hi> and prepoſſeſſions, which <hi>cuſtom</hi> and <hi>education</hi> have formed in them; or from <hi>adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to parties and mutuall <hi>agitations,</hi> whereby they hope to drive on ſome worldly and ſecular concernments; rather than from true and <hi>impartiall principles</hi> of right <hi>reaſon,</hi> Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>precept,</hi> and Eccleſiaſticall <hi>practiſe;</hi> which threefold cord, twiſted into one, is not eaſily broken: And which, beyond all diſputes, affords, both in doctrine and diſcipline, in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and practiſe, as to <hi>inward piety,</hi> and <hi>outward polity,</hi> the ſureſt meaſures of Religion, and bounds of conſcience; which are then moſt <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unblameable,</hi> when they look direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe great deſignes and ends of every wiſe man and good Chriſtian, the glory of God, the honour of Chriſt, the peace of the Church, and Soules eternall welfare; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſiniſter <hi>ſquintings</hi> to ſecular ends, or <hi>warpings</hi> to worldly deſignes, which are the <hi>moths</hi> of Religion, the peſts of ſociety, the overlayings of charity, and the <hi>Incubuſſes</hi> of Conſcience; eaſily ſeiſing upon Chriſtians of weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtrong paſſions; for which we need not goe far to ſee many and unhappy <hi>inſtances.</hi>

            <p>For, what ſerious and well adviſed Chriſtian ſees not; how vehement <hi>drawings</hi> and <hi>impulſes</hi> in matters of Religion are made upon men by weak, and at firſt ſcarſe perceptible, <hi>byaſſes</hi> of <hi>opinions,</hi> and <hi>hopes</hi> of advantages: How, want of <hi>ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>ſincerity</hi> is the greateſt motion of violent affections in moſt men: How, the leſſe they weigh thoſe things, they call <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> the more eagerly they purſue and extoll them? (The moſt wiſe and <hi>gracious</hi> men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the moſt grave and calm, the moſt ſerious and conſtant) <hi>Vulgar devotion</hi> and <hi>heats,</hi> like weak fires, and dubious flames, are uſually kindled by <hi>light fewell,</hi> and fomented with fear materials; Blazing, like <hi>Comets,</hi> the more prodigiouſly,

            <p>Hence, not onely the glory of <hi>outward ſucceſſes,</hi> and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>proſperities,</hi> attending the number, policy, or prevalency of any faction, makes many Chriſtians, (ere they are aware of it) turn <hi>Turkes,</hi> and ſecretly ſubſcribe to <hi>Mahumetaniſm;</hi> (which for many <hi>centuries</hi> hath outvived Chriſtianity in point of <hi>victorious progreſſes,</hi> military advantages, and latitude of <hi>Empire</hi>) The current of worldly <hi>events,</hi> like <hi>quick-tides,</hi> eaſily and undiſcernibly carrying many Chriſtians from that courſe of pious <hi>strictneſſe,</hi> and conſcientious <hi>exactneſſe</hi> in truth, juſtice, and charity, which they ought alwayes to ſteere without any variation, according to the clear and fixed <hi>Word of God</hi> in Scripture; and not according to his dark permiſſions, or unſearchable <hi>workings</hi> in <hi>providence;</hi> which are alwayes juſt and to be admired, as from the divine wiſdome and juſtice; but not alwayes to be approved or imitated, as from mans wickedneſſe and folly; which like poyſonous drugs are in themſelves deadly and to be abhorred: however the skill of the great and good Phyſitian, God, knows how to attemper and apply them as Phyſick and Theriacals, to purge, or puniſh; to cure, or correct the diſtempers of his Church and people.</p>

            <p>How many mens <hi>Religion</hi> lies in their <hi>admiration</hi> of ſome mens perſons, gifts, piety, and ſuppoſed zeal, in their being of his ſect, way, <hi>body,</hi> fraternity, and <hi>confederacy?</hi> when yet many times they have but an <hi>Idol</hi> for their God, though they glory to have a <hi>Levite</hi> to be their <hi>Prieſt:</hi> Able men may have great infirmities; and learned men groſſe errors; foul diſeaſes oft attend fair faces: Doting ſectaries will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the <hi>pudenda</hi> of their Prieſts, and magnifie what is moſt diſhoneſt, and uncomely in their ringleaders.

            </p>
            <p>Many have little that they can <hi>fancy,</hi> or call <hi>Religion</hi> in them, but onely a <hi>fierceneſſe</hi> for that <hi>ſide,</hi> to which they take, a moroſeneſſe, cenſoriouſneſſe, and ſupercilious indifferency towards all, but thoſe whom they count <hi>theirs.</hi> Vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>oppoſing,</hi> what ever <hi>Adverſary</hi> they undertake; abhorring all they doe, or hold in <hi>piety or prudence;</hi> branding all they like not with the <hi>mark of Antichriſt;</hi> and crying downe what ever by any Chriſtians is diverſly <hi>obſerved</hi> in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of their Religion: Hence many of the <hi>loweſt form</hi> of Chriſtians, place much of their Religion, in <hi>innovating

            <p>Some, here with us in <hi>England,</hi> (a place whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> much diſpoſeth people to <hi>prophecies,</hi> novelties, and varieties) are (as <hi>Pygmalion</hi> with his Image) ſo inamoured with their (Corpuſculo's) the little <hi>new bodies</hi> of their gathered Churches; that they deny any <hi>Nationall Church</hi> in any larger <hi>aſſociatings</hi> of Chriſtians, by <hi>harmonies</hi> of confeſſion, and peaceable ſubordinations; yea, and many will allow no <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> nor any religious ſenſe to that <hi>article of our Creed;</hi> denying any true Church at all to be now in the world. Some place all <hi>Church power</hi> in paucities, in parities, in popular levellings, and Independencies; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers contemn all thoſe <hi>broken bodies,</hi> as <hi>ſchiſmaticall ſlips;</hi> having nothing in them of that goodly beauty, ſtature, ſtrength, and integrity, to which the Church of Chriſt was wont to grow; and wherein it flouriſhed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued conſpicuous ſo many hundred of years; before theſe novelties were broached or brewed, either in <hi>England,</hi> or any other countrey.</p>
            <p>The height of ſome mens Religion and Reformation is, to have neither <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor <hi>Miniſters,</hi> of the <hi>ancient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſucceſsion,</hi> and <hi>ordination;</hi> Others refuſe theſe alſo of the <hi>new Presbyterian ſtamp;</hi> (which is not much older here in <hi>England,</hi> than the figure and ſuperſcription of the <hi>laſt coin</hi>) A third will have no <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but ſuch as the common people ſhall try, chuſe, conſecrate, and judge.

Chriſtians, muſt not after the ſhort and more compendious methods of their fancies, therefore neglect the ſign or ceremony, becauſe they preſume of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but rather with humble obedience doe the duty and uſe the meanes divinely inſtituted, that they may obtain the grace offered. On the ſame grounds, all outward <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations</hi> among Chriſtians may be deſpiſed and aboliſhed, by thoſe that pretend to the Spirits inward efficacy; which is never in any man that doth not obey the Goſpell in its outward mandates, as well as the Spirit in its inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Proud, idle and ignorant fancies are dayly finding ſhorter wayes to heaven than the wiſdome of Chriſt hath
<pb facs="tcp:125554:9"/> laid out to his Church; in following of which no good Chriſtian can judge, that there is either piety, peace, or ſafety.</p>
            <p>Some boaſt much of their popular and plauſible <hi>gifts,</hi> for knowledge, utterance, prayer, &amp;c. others ſlight all, but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace,</hi> and the Spirits <hi>dwelling in them.</hi> Some dote much upon their <hi>ſelect fraternities</hi> and <hi>covenanting congregations;</hi> others are onely for <hi>private illuminations,</hi> ſolitary ſeekings, ſublime raptures, and higher aſſurances.

Some make every thing a ſin and errour, which they like not; others count nothing a ſin, to which they have an impulſe, and are <hi>free</hi> as they call it.

            <p>All which, men of <hi>excellent learning,</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> in this Church, have valiantly ſuſtained, and happily repelled; to the great advancement of Gods glory, the proſperity of this Nation, the honour of this reformed Church, and the comfort of all judicious Chriſtians; And this was chiefly done by the able and accurate <hi>pens</hi> of the godly and <hi>learned Miniſters;</hi> who needed (in thoſe times) no other <hi>defence</hi> on their part, either for order, government, maintenance, Miniſtry or doctrine; All which were then preſerved from <hi>vulgar injuries</hi> and inſolencies by the ſame power and ſword, which defended thoſe civill <hi>ſanctions</hi> and lawes, which eſtabliſhed and preſerved all things of <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> as well as of civill and <hi>ſecular</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>Untill theſe laſt <hi>fatall times,</hi> which pregnant with civill
<pb facs="tcp:125554:13"/> wars and diſſenſions, have brought forth ſuch great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and changes in Church and State; wherein <hi>Scholars</hi> and <hi>Churchmen,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>pens</hi> and <hi>bookes,</hi> have to contend with <hi>ſwords</hi> and <hi>piſtols.</hi> Which weapons of <hi>carnall warfare,</hi> were unwonted to be applyed either to the planting, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, or reforming of Chriſtian Religion; onely proper to be uſed for the preſervation of what is by law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>ſchiſmaticall perturbations;</hi> (For it was not the <hi>vinegar,</hi> but the <hi>oil</hi> of Chriſtian Religion; not its fierineſſe, but its meekneſſe; not its force, but its pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ever made its way through the hardeſt <hi>rocks,</hi> and <hi>hearts.</hi>) And by theſe ſtrange <hi>Engines,</hi> theſe new <hi>armes of fleſh,</hi> we have hitherto onely ſeen acted and fulfilled with much <hi>horror,</hi> miſery and confuſion, thoſe things in this Church and Nation, which were foreſeen and <hi>foretold</hi> by two eminent, and learned perſons, yet of different opinions, as to the extern matters of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall polity;</hi> Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Hooker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Brightman;</hi> the one in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall polity:</hi> the other in his comment on the third chapter of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> Who many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe in times of peace, and ſetledneſſe in this Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land foretold,</hi> not by any infallible ſpirit of <hi>prophecy,</hi> (for then the <hi>later</hi> of them would not have been ſo much miſtaken in the <hi>fate</hi> of his dear <hi>Philadelphia</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>) but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>prudence,</hi> conjecturing, what was probable to come to paſſe, according to the fears of the one, and the hopes of the other: in caſe the then ſpreading, though ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>differences</hi> and parties in Religion, (which they then ſaw made many <hi>Zealouſly</hi> &amp; boldly diſcontented) came to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch power, as every ſide aims at, when they pretend to carry on <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> and Reformation; wherein, <hi>immoderation</hi> being uſually ſtiled <hi>Zeal;</hi> and <hi>moderation, lukewarmneſſe;</hi> it was eaſie for ſagacious men to foreſee and foretell, what <hi>exceſſes,</hi> the tranſports of inferiours would in all probability urge upon <hi>ſuperiours;</hi> if ever theſe <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged power</hi> ſo weakly and unadviſedly, that any <hi>aſpiring</hi> and diſcontented <hi>party</hi> might come to gain <hi>power,</hi> in a way not
<pb facs="tcp:125554:14"/> uſuall; which at the very firſt <hi>rupture</hi> and advantage, would think it ſelf eaſily <hi>abſolved</hi> from all former ties of obedience, and ſubjection to governours in Church or State; without which liberty and abſolution, it is not <hi>poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to carry on by force any Novelties and pretended amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion contrary to what is eſtabliſhed in any Church or Nation.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we ſee, to our <hi>ſmart</hi> and <hi>ſorrow;</hi> that the <hi>deluge</hi> foretold would break in, hath ſo overflowed this and the neighbour Churches; that not only Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> blear-ey'd <hi>Leah,</hi> his odious <hi>Peninnah,</hi> his ſo abhorred <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> (the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall</hi> order and eminency) but even his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> his admired <hi>Hannah,</hi> his <hi>divine Presbytery</hi> it ſelf; yea &amp; the whole function of the Miniſtry feels, and fears the terror of that <hi>inundation,</hi> which far beyond his <hi>divination,</hi> hath prevailed, not only over his ſo deſpiſed <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which he made to be type of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (truly) not without paſſion and partiality, (as I think with far wiſer men) He not calmly diſtinguiſhing between the conſtitution and execution of things: between the faults of perſons, and the order of places: between what was prudentiall, and what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; what is tolerable, and what is abominable in any Church, as to its extern form and polity: but alſo over his <hi>darling</hi> and ſo <hi>adored Philadelphia;</hi> which he makes to anſwer to the <hi>Scottiſh, Palatinate</hi> or <hi>Geneva form of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government</hi> and <hi>diſcipline;</hi> as if that Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in its primitive conſtitution under the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and government of its Angell, had any thing different from, or better than the other neighbour Churches; which is no way probable, nor appears either in Scripture or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall hiſtories; However, it might be commendable in its Angell or Preſident, for its greater zeal and exacter care to preſerve that doctrine, diſcipline, and order, which it had lately received from the Apoſtles; and which, no doubt, was the ſame in each Church, who had their ſeverall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Overſeers alike; which all Antiquity owned for thoſe Paſtors, Preſidents, or Biſhops, to whoſe charge they were reſpectively committed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:125554:14"/>
            <p>As for that <hi>evomition,</hi> or Gods <hi>ſpewing this Church of England out of his mouth,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſo <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully threatens;</hi> It muſt be confeſſed that the ſins of all ſorts of Chriſtians in this Church, and of Miniſters as much as any, have made them <hi>nauſeous</hi> and burthenſome to the <hi>Divine patience;</hi> both in their <hi>lukewarm</hi> formalities, and <hi>fulſome affectations</hi> of Religion; in their empty <hi>pompes,</hi> and emptier <hi>popularities:</hi> So that Gods <hi>patience</hi> once turned into <hi>juſt fury,</hi> hath indeed terribly powred out his <hi>vengeance</hi> on all degrees and eſtates in this Nation: by ſuffering <hi>flouds of miſeries,</hi> and <hi>billows of contempt</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm (for a time) the face of this Church, (as of old wars, hereſies, and ſchiſms waſted the <hi>Aſiatick, African,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches) not more, it may be, upon the account of <hi>Miniſters</hi> weakneſſe and unworthineſſe, than upon that of peoples levity, pride, and ingratefull inconſtancy; which hath been a great means to bring on and continue theſe overflowing ſtreams: Which nothing but the mighty <hi>power</hi> of God, by the help of good and wiſe men, can <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi> and aſſwage; ſo that the face of this Church and its Miniſtry may yet appear in greater beauty and true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, after its ſo <hi>great ſquallor,</hi> and deformity: which is not to be deſpaired of, through <hi>Gods mercy;</hi> yet in a farre other way than ever Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> foreſaw.</p>
            <p>But when, and by what means this ſhall be done, the Authour of this Apology doth not, as a Prophet, undertake to foretell; onely he obſerves the uſuall <hi>methods</hi> of Gods Providence, in the <hi>midst of judgement to remember mercy:</hi> and after he hath ſorely afflicted, to <hi>repent of the evill,</hi> and <hi>return</hi> to an humble <hi>penitent people,</hi> with <hi>tender mercies;</hi> ſo that we may hope his <hi>wrath will not endure</hi> for ever; nor that he hath quite <hi>forgotten</hi> to be gracious, or ſhut up his loving <hi>kindeneſſe in diſpleaſure.</hi> Alſo hee conſiders the <hi>wonted viciſſitudes</hi> of humane affairs, ariſing from the changes <hi>incident to mens mindes,</hi> who weary of thoſe <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> and <hi>preſſures</hi> neceſſarily attending all forcible changes in Church or State; and long fruſtrated with vain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:125554:15"/> of enjoying thoſe better conditions in things civill and religious, which are alwayes at firſt liberally promiſed and expected; at laſt they are prone with the ſame <hi>impetuoſity,</hi> to retire, (as the ebbing Sea) from thoſe fallacious or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <hi>novelties,</hi> to which the breath of ſome politick or <hi>paſsionate</hi> ſpirits had raiſed them, ſo much above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>mark</hi> of true Chriſtian religion, as to <hi>drown</hi> or threaten to carry away all thoſe many happy enjoyments of truth, peace, order, government, and Miniſtry, which formerly they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: Not wholly (it may be) without; but yet with fewer and more <hi>tolerable grievances;</hi> which humble Chriſtians ought to look upon in any ſetled Church and State, rather as exerciſes of their <hi>patience,</hi> duty, and charity; than as <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of their ſpirits: Knowing that <hi>impatience</hi> uſually puniſheth it ſelf, by applying <hi>remedies</hi> ſharper than the <hi>ſufferings;</hi> eaſily and haſtily running down the <hi>hill,</hi> as from health to ſickneſſe, from peace to war, from good to bad, from bad to worſe; but very ſlowly <hi>returning</hi> from evill to good, or recovering up the hill, from <hi>worſe</hi> to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Miniſters of the Church of England,</hi> of all degrees, ſeem, now, to have an <hi>harder part</hi> to act, for their honor and wiſdome, than ever they had under <hi>any Rulers,</hi> profeſſing to be Chriſtian and reformed. But they may not therefore weakly diſclaim, or meanly <hi>deſert</hi> their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination and holy function; nor may they <hi>deſpair</hi> of Gods (if they have not mans) protection, who can ſoon make their very <hi>enemies to be at peace with them;</hi> and ſtir up many friends unexpectedly for them. It may be through the <hi>Lords mercy,</hi> this <hi>winters floud</hi> ſhall be for their mendment or fertility, and not for their utter vaſtation and ruine: This <hi>fire</hi> ſhall not conſume them, but refine them; this <hi>winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will be their <hi>purging;</hi> and this <hi>ſhaking</hi> their <hi>ſetling:</hi> (As <hi>oppoſitions</hi> of old gave the greateſt <hi>confirmations</hi> and poliſhings to thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> which were moſt exerciſed with the <hi>hammer,</hi> or file of <hi>heriticall pravity,</hi> or <hi>ſchiſmaticall fury.</hi>

            <p>If either Papall, or Anabaptiſticall and Levelling ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies muſt at length after ſeverall windings and turnings be gratified with their utter ruine and deſtruction, (which God forbid) yet while Miniſters have leave and liberty to pray, to preach, to print, to doe well, and worthily, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid they ſhould ſo farre <hi>injure God,</hi> good men, and ſo <hi>good a cauſe,</hi> as not Chriſtianly to endeavour its <hi>defence;</hi> which at worſt is to be done by <hi>comely ſuffering:</hi> And who knows but that when theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> both againſt ſuperſtition and confuſion in the Church ſhall ſeem to be ſlain, caſt out, and buryed, they may live again, to the aſtoniſhment both of friends and enemies?</p>

            <p>That ſo, at leaſt if the world can leſſe diſcern, for what cauſe the Miniſtry and Miniſters are now to be deſtroyed, they may ſee upon what grounds of piety, or policy they were ſo long preſerved in <hi>peace, plenty,</hi> and <hi>honour:</hi> And for what reaſons they now ſeek (as their pious predeceſſors did) to maintain not their <hi>perſons</hi> ſo much, as their <hi>office</hi> and function, in its due <hi>order</hi> and <hi>authority;</hi> that ſo they might have tranſmitted it in an holy and <hi>unblameable ſucceſſion</hi> to poſterity; as that, which in their conſciences they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think to be a moſt divine and <hi>Christian Inſtitution:</hi> Beneficiall for the good of the Church, and of all mankinde; which in former ages, was ever eſteemed the <hi>glory,</hi> and bleſſing of this, or any other Nation; The ſetter forth of the <hi>light,</hi> wiſdome, power, and <hi>love</hi> of the <hi>eternall God</hi> in his Son Jeſus Chriſt for the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of ſinners; and which thouſands of Chriſtians in all ages and places have experienced, and approved to be to their ſoules the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life unto life,</hi> the mighty power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>The <hi>grim</hi> and ſad <hi>aſpect</hi> on all hands upon Miniſters, makes the Authour out of charity to himſelf and others, as willing to give a fair account of his <hi>profeſsion,</hi> ſo loath to offend any ſober and judicious Reader, or to contract the <hi>enmity</hi> of any others of ruder tempers, by any raſh ſtroke or inconſiderate daſh of his pen, to which he may be ſubject, and for which he begs pardon, both of God and man, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have eſcaped; which yet may be ſo far <hi>venial,</hi> as its <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſharpneſſe</hi> aims at no <hi>mens perſon,</hi> but onely at their ſuppoſed errors, which are grown in ſome ſo rough and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, both in words and deeds, againſt poore <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that they had need to meet with ſomething, that hath good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and uſefull ſharpneſſe; and not with that phlegmatick and ſanguine ſoftneſſe, which impudent men eaſily baffle and put both to the bluſh and ſilence: yet hee meddles not, ſave with great reſpect and tenderneſſe, with any thing of Civill Power; which no man may wiſely diſpute, that is not able to reſiſt, (it is fooliſh to ſhake the pen <hi>againſt the ſword,</hi> or oppoſe <hi>armed Legions</hi> with flocks of Geeſe;) No man may diſcreetly offend, while, as he muſt neceſſarily, ſo he may <hi>honeſtly</hi> and ſafely be <hi>ſubject:</hi> Prudence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>private men</hi> to leave the accounts of <hi>Ruling power</hi> to mens <hi>own conſciences,</hi> and to the <hi>Supream Over-ruler;</hi> who beſt knowes, as by what <hi>means</hi> they obtain it, ſo to what ends, and in what <hi>manner</hi> they uſe it.

            <p>Therefore this Author preſumes, that the fair and free vindication of ſo publique an intereſt, as this of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry (which is his proper ſphear and calling) can diſpleaſe no men, that have candor, wit, honeſty, honour, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or true Religion in them: Nor will it anger ſober men to be ſhewed what is amiſs, and how it may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which poſſibly they may be as unable, as willing to doe; Diſeaſes may ſometimes exceed the Art of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; violent Paroxyſms are ſometimes better left to ſpend themſelves, than provoked and encountred with medicines.

            <p>Although the ſtudy, and knowledge of the <hi>Stars</hi> be very worthy of a wiſe and Chriſtian man, becauſe in their beauty, luſtre, and numberleſſe number, in their vaſt magnitude, and height, in their admirable motion, and various influences, the <hi>wonderfull</hi> glory of the Creators power and wiſdome is eminently ſet forth, beyond what vulgar eyes diſcern:

            <p>But the <hi>badneſſe</hi> of the times, or madn ſſe rather of any <hi>men</hi> in them, makes this <hi>cauſe</hi> never the worſe; Indeed it is ſo great and ſo good, having in it ſo much of Gods glory, and mans welfare, that it merits what it can hardly finde in ſecular greatneſſe, a <hi>proportionate patron;</hi> who had need to be one of the beſt men, and the <hi>boldeſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> And therefore is the addreſſe ſo generall, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our great <hi>Maſter the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (the <hi>founder</hi>

The ſelf-demonſtrating beams of <hi>ſacred Truths</hi> need no bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed reflexions: By ſoft and eaſie breathings the Lord hath oft diſpelled the <hi>groſſeſt fogs</hi> and <hi>blindeſt miſts,</hi> which roſe in his Church; His fair and moſt <hi>orient pearles</hi> are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found in <hi>rough and unpoliſhed ſhels;</hi> The excellency of his <hi>heavenly Treaſure,</hi> and power doth beſt appeare in <hi>earthen veſſels.</hi> The plain and main Truths of Chriſtian Religion (among which this of <hi>an holy ordained Miniſtry</hi> is one) like <hi>ſoverain</hi> and <hi>victorious Beauties</hi> loſe nothing by the <hi>meanneſſe</hi> of their dreſſe, or unaccurateneſſe of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; it is enough if they can but freely appeare like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>This faſhion of writing by way of Apology (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a diffuſed and <hi>pathetick</hi> ſtile) was, indeed, judged the beſt and fitteſt, as for the Subject and the times, ſo alſo for this <hi>Author;</hi> conſidering the little leiſure, the ſhort time, the great variety of <hi>other buſineſſe,</hi> and diſtractions upon him: beſides the <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>precipitancy</hi> of the ruine, daily threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Miniſtry and Miniſters; if God by the juſtice,
<pb facs="tcp:125554:24"/> wiſdome, and piety of ſome men did not defend them and divert that miſchief. For the preventing of which ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have wrote in vindication of the Miniſtry after a more ſuccinct and Syllogiſtick way of argumentation; But the Antiminiſteriall diſeaſe, having ſeiſed not ſo much the heads, as the hearts of men; and depraved affections having ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many from the judgements; it was thought neceſſary to apply ſome remedy at once to both, ſetting Chriſtians in the Truth, and exciting them to ſuch a love of it and zeal to it, as may beſt encounter the heady boldneſſe of thoſe which oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>If the Authour have in this larger way done any thing worthy ſo <hi>excellent a Subject,</hi> it muſt be firſt imputed to Gods <hi>gracious</hi> aſſiſtance, and the bleſſing of prayers, more <hi>than of ſtudies;</hi> wherein it may be the <hi>charitable flames</hi> of many worthy Chriſtians have greatly helped his infirmities; Next, it muſt be aſcribed to the <hi>ſacredneſſe, dignity,</hi> and <hi>ampleneſse</hi> of the matter, or Subject handled, which (as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of old obſerved) like rich ſoile, and good ground raiſeth to <hi>generous productions</hi> the weaker ſpirits of any thing <hi>ſown,</hi> or <hi>planted</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Authors ambition</hi> is in nothing more than to excell in the diſcharge of his duty, as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of this Church; that he might <hi>finiſh his courſe</hi> with joy; and alſo to have <hi>equalled</hi> with height of abilities and induſtry, the <hi>excellency</hi> of this Cauſe, which is of ſo high concernment, to the glory of God; to the honour of his Saviour; (to the ſalvation of ſo many ſoules) to the happineſſe of this <hi>Church;</hi> to the bleſſing of this Nation; to the <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſo many worthy men, his Fathers and Brethren of the Miniſtry, who make conſcience not onely to diſcharge their duty, but alſo to preſerve the divine authority, and holy ſucceſſion of their heavenly calling as Chriſtian Miniſters; whom the bleſſing of God hath as much honored and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firrmed in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as in any other under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; having made them in every place, where they were planted, as the trees of knowledge and of life; bringing the

            <p>And if he have not been able to adde any <hi>ſtrength</hi> or honor to <hi>this cauſe,</hi> (which ſome others before him, have either fairly touched, or ſomewhat fully handled) yet he may adde to the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> who have or ſhall give <hi>teſtimony</hi> to this great Truth, holy Order, and happy <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who muſt not ceaſe to <hi>prophecy,</hi> though they be clothed <hi>in ſack cloth, Revel.</hi> 11.3.</p>

               <p>I Have done with the <hi>firſt part of this Cavill or Calumny,</hi> which ſeeks to bandy the <hi>Miniſtry of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt the Papall and Romiſh wall;</hi> that they may make it either rebound to a popular and <hi>Independent ſide;</hi> or elſe fall into the <hi>hazard</hi> of having no true <hi>Christian Miniſtry at all;</hi> from both which I ſhall in like fort endevour to reſcue this our <hi>holy Function</hi> and Succeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſecond ſtroak therefore which I am to take, is made with great Artifice and popular cunning againſt the</hi> Miniſtry <hi>of this Church, as it was derived and continued</hi> by the hands of Biſhops, <hi>who were as Preſidents, or chief Fathers in the work of Ordination among their Brethren and Sons (the Presbyters) or Miniſters within their ſeverall Dioceſſes; Theſe Prelates or Biſhops, the</hi> Objectors proteſt highly againſt, <hi>as being</hi> not Plants of Chriſts planting; <hi>whoſe Authority being lately pulled up by</hi> power, <hi>ſo that they ſeem to have no more</hi> place or influence in this Church or Nation, <hi>the</hi> Presbyterie <hi>alſo, and whole order of the</hi> former Miniſtry <hi>(they ſay) muſt neceſſarily alſo</hi> fail and wither, <hi>which were but branches, and</hi> ſlips derived from the ſtem or root of Epiſcopall Ordination.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee in a few years, the <hi>Anti-ministeriall</hi> fury is <hi>cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelling,</hi> even <hi>Presbyters</hi> themſelves, with that ſtaff which ſome of them put into <hi>vulgar hands,</hi> purpoſely to <hi>beat their Fathers,</hi> the grave and antient Biſhops, and utterly to baniſh that <hi>Venerable and Catholick Order,</hi> or <hi>Eminent Authority</hi> of Epiſcopacy out of the Church; what the <hi>Dove-like innocency</hi> of thoſe fierce and rigid Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>hearts</hi> might be, as to their <hi>godly intentions,</hi> I know not; but I am ſure they wanted that <hi>wiſdome of the Serpent,</hi> which ſeeks above all to <hi>preſerve its head;</hi> whence life, health, motion, and orderly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, deſcending to other parts, do eaſily <hi>repair</hi> and heal, what ever leſſer hurt or bruiſe may befall them,</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be confeſſed, that as the <hi>Events</hi> have been very ſad, ſo the <hi>advantages</hi> have been great, which the <hi>Anti-miniſteriall</hi> party have gained, by the prepoſterous zeal of ſome <hi>Anti-Epiſcopall ſpirits,</hi> which tranſported them, not only beyond and againſt all bounds, or <hi>rules</hi> of Reaſon, Order, Scripture, Eccleſiaſticall Cuſtome, and Laws here in <hi>England,</hi> but even contrary to their own <hi>former,</hi> and ſome of their <hi>preſent judgements,</hi> touching Epiſcopall <hi>Preſidency,</hi> which they never did, nor do yet hold to be <hi>unlawfull</hi> in the Church,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:125554:158"/> how ever it might be attended with ſome <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi> too, not ariſing from the nature of that <hi>Order,</hi> and power, which is good, but from the <hi>corruption</hi> of thoſe men that might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it amiſs. This makes many of theſe Miniſters have now ſo <hi>much work,</hi> to take off that <hi>leproſie</hi> from their <hi>own heads,</hi> which they told the people had ſo much <hi>infected the Biſhops hands;</hi> by the Impoſition of which, they yet own their Miniſteriall power, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders to have been <hi>rightly derived</hi> to them, in that <hi>Ordination by Biſhops,</hi> which was uſed here in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as in all antient Churches.</p>
               <p>It is never too late to <hi>rectifie,</hi> and <hi>repent</hi> of, any miſtakes and miſcarriages incident to us, as poor ſinfull mortals. Although Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> (which ever was as a <hi>grand pillar</hi> of the Churches Miniſtry, Order and Government,) hath been much ſhaken and thruſt aſide by mans power, or paſſion, to the great weakning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of the whole Fabrick and Function of the Miniſtry, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the peace and polity of <hi>this Church;</hi> yet wiſe men may poſſible ſee, after theſe thick <hi>clouds and duſt of diſpute,</hi> what <hi>is of God in true Epiſcopacy;</hi> yea, and they may be <hi>perſwaded</hi> to preſerve and reſtore, what is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>comly</hi> in it, however they pare off what is deformed, ſuperfluous and <hi>Comberſome;</hi> (in the behalf of which I am neither a pleader, nor an approver.)</p>
               <p>It is now no time in <hi>England</hi> either to flatter, or fear the face of Epiſcopacy, or ſiniſterly to accept the perſons of Biſhops. There is nothing now can be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> to move me to touch with reſpect thoſe goodly <hi>ruines</hi> (from which the <hi>glory</hi> of riches and honour are now ſo far removed,) but only <hi>matter of conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>integrity of my judgement;</hi> And therefore I here crave leave without offence to any, that are <hi>truly godly</hi> (either Miniſters or others) who may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from me in this point,) freely, yet as briefly as I can, to diſcover my judgement, touching this ſo <hi>controverted</hi> point of Epiſcopacy, in which from words men have faln to blows, and from waſting of ink, to the ſhedding of <hi>blood.</hi> I ſee that other men of different ſenſe, daily take their freedom to vent themſelves againſt all Biſhops, and all Epiſcopacy; ſome of them ſo rudely and unſavorily, as if they hoped by their <hi>evill breath,</hi> to render that <hi>venerable</hi> name, and <hi>order,</hi> ever abhorred, and execrable to Chriſtian minds; which to learned and ſober Chriſtians ever was, and ſtill is, as a ſweet <hi>Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured forth;</hi> nor doth it loſe of its divine and <hi>antient fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy</hi> by the <hi>fractures of theſe times,</hi> which have broken (it may be) not with devotion and love, ſo much as with hatred, and paſſion, that <hi>Alabaſter-box</hi> of civill protection and Sanction, in which it was <hi>here,</hi> for many hundreds of years, happily <hi>preſerved</hi> from vulgar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, and <hi>Schiſmaticall contempt.</hi> Why may not I preſume to

               <p>Nor doth <hi>that Reformer of Tithes</hi> lay to heart the <hi>diſſatisfactions,</hi> and ſcandall of many as wiſe and as godly mens conſciences as his pretious ones are, who are <hi>(ten for one)</hi> perſwaded; that they ought, as by lawes of the Land, ſo in all <hi>Religion</hi> to God, and gratitude to their Miniſters, pay their Tithes <hi>immediately,</hi> and truly to them, which they had much rather doe, than have the beſt place, that any man can fancy in this new deſigned Office and <hi>Exchequer</hi> for tithes; Nor do I beleive a like project would pleaſe that great projector, if one ſhould take his <hi>cloak</hi> from his home, and make him ride ten, twenty or thirty miles to fetch it, every time he would <hi>make uſe of it.</hi> Certainly Tithes are by all equity and law; as much due to every Miniſter in his place, as the <hi>coat,</hi> which that <hi>Propoſer</hi> hath <hi>on his back.</hi> Nor is the <hi>property</hi> of things, onely to be conſidered; but the <hi>proximity</hi> alſo, and the <hi>conveniency</hi> of uſing and enjoying them; which the Law alſo <hi>intends</hi> to every man, in his goods: For my part I <hi>like not,</hi> either the <hi>changing</hi> of the <hi>ſtream,</hi> or of the channell of Tithes; becauſe it will but make it winde further off, or goe more about; and the new channell will lick up a great deale of the <hi>old ſtream,</hi> ſo that but little will come at laſt to the Miniſters Mill. The former courſe of paying them to the Miniſter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately is much eaſier cleared, where ever any obſtructions or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies ſhall be found, either as to the Miniſters, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; How eaſily are far greater ſums dayly gathered in every pariſh, without any ſuits at Law or trouble, by the ordinary Officers, which may in this caſe eaſily be authoriſed to doe for Miniſters, as Church-wardens and Overſeers for the poor doe in their rates and cuſtomes.

The Laws of the land paſſed and conveyed Tithes to the Clergy and their ſucceſſors for Gods ſervice, even then when they were forbidden, for the moſt part, to <hi>marry;</hi> and enjoined to lead a ſingle life: O how would the munificence of thoſe times have burſt theſe men with envy againſt the Clergy in their rich Celibacy; who repine to ſee them thus moderately provided for, when they are moſt what charged with families, and many relations! 2.
